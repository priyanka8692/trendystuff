## Creating md file

### Usage
We write documentation in txt, docx file. 
Similarly we can write documentation in md file.

md file has few tricks. For example for making any text as heading we need to add # for h1, ## for h2 etc.

So for making "This is heading sample" text as heading, we can simply write
### This is heading sample

In sublime or notepad, when we open the md file, we will not see the text style changed as heading. But when we open this md file in github, github will understand and will show it as heading.

There are other styles also like bold, italic etc etc.

### Why we create md file
We can create md file for documentation. All the documentation of code will be written in md files so that we can read it in nice format from github itself.

### md file naming
we can give any name to md file.
But if we name our file readme.md, then github understands it little separetly.

### What is readme.md and how it is shown by github
1. If we create a file named readme.md and put it in root folder of code, then we don't need to open that file in github to read it. It will be shown automatically.
2. Similarly if we create a file named readme.md and put it in any sub folder of code, as soon as we open that sub folder in github, we will see that readme.md file automatically. We don't need to open it.
