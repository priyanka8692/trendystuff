## creating md file:
We write documentation in txt, docx file. 
Similarly we can write documentation in md file.

md file has few tricks. For example for making any text as heading we need to add # for h1, ## for h2 etc.

So for making "This is heading sample" text as heading, we can simply write
### This is heading sample

In sublime or notepad, when we open the md file, we will not see the text style changed as heading. But when we open this md file in github, github will understand and will show it as heading.

There are other styles also like bold, italic etc etc.
